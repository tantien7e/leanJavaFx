It served as the Western Capital of the Hồ Dynasty (1400-1407). It is located in Tây Giai commune, Vĩnh Lộc District, in Thanh Hóa Province, in Vietnam's North Central Coast region. The castle was constructed from stone blocks, each of which is 2×1×0.7 m (6.6×3.3×2.3 ft) size on average. Except for its gates, the castle is mostly ruined.
