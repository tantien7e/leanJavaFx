By 2025, the plan is to replant about 150 hectares of mangroves, as part of a five-year plan to restore the forest. Mangrove trees form an important natural barrier against natural disasters and in some way protect the Mekong Delta. The national park has great biodiversity. 26 species of mammals, 43 species of reptiles, 9 species of amphibians, 233 species of fish and 93 species of birds live here."@en ;
