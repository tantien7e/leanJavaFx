The Nam Định Textile Factory was established by French colonists in 1898. During the French Occupation, the Nam Định Textile Factory employed over 18,000 people, about a tenth of the local population. The Factory played an important role during the Vietnam War as a centre of resistance against the Americans. Ho Chi Minh visited the Factory several times. The museum retains many relics of the war. In 2016, the Textile Factory was relocated to Hoa Xa Industrial Park in Nghia Hung District, and redevelopment of the factory site began."@en .
