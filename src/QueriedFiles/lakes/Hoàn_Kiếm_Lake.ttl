In the past, the lake was variously named \"Luc Thuy Lake\" (Vietnamese: Hồ Lục Thủy, meaning \"Green Water Lake\" - aptly named for the water's color) or \"Thuy Quan Lake\" (Vietnamese: Hồ Thủy Quân, meaning \"Mariner's Lake\"). The lake is one of the major scenic spots in the city and serves as a focal point for its public life."@en ;
